We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw <b>[1]</b> and referenced by Abramowitz and Stegun <b>[2]</b>, for which the function domain is partitioned into the two intervals <b>[0,8]</b> and <b>(8,inf)</b>, and Chebyshev polynomial expansions are employed in each interval. Relative error on the domain <b>[0,30]</b> using IEEE arithmetic is documented <b>[3]</b> as having a peak of 5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000).

sinc:

        copy: i0
        description: "Return the normalized sinc function.

The normalized sinc function is <b>sin(pi*x)/(pi*x).</b>

<b>sinc(0)</b> is the limit value 1.

The name sinc is short for \"sine cardinal\" or \"sinus cardinalis\".

The sinc function is used in various signal processing applications, including in anti-aliasing, in the construction of a Lanczos resampling filter, and in interpolation.

For bandlimited interpolation of discrete-time signals, the ideal interpolation kernel is proportional to the sinc function."
