        description: "Compute bit-wise inversion, or bit-wise NOT, element-wise.

Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python operator <b>~</b>.

For signed integer inputs, the two's complement is returned. In a two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of representing signed integers on computers <b>[1]</b>. A N-bit two's-complement system can represent every integer in the range <b>-2<sup>N-1</sup> to +2<sup>N-1</sup>-1</b>.
